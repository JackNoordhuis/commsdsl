# Visual Protocol Analysis
The [CommsChampion Ecosystem](https://commschamp.github.io/) contains
[CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt) project. The latter is
the set of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) based applications which provide a convenient environment to
visualize the protocol message contents as well as debug message exchange between I/O endpoints.
There is a [wiki page](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt/wiki/How-to-Use-CommsChampion-Tools)
explaining how to use the tools. This documentation page explains how to
generate the code for the protocol definition plugin and build it.

## Build Order

- Build and install [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) project.
- Build and install [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt) project.
- Generate the protocol definition project using **commsdsl2comms**.
- Properly build and install the generated protocol definition project. It will generate appropriate cmake config
  file allowing the protocol headers only library to be found using `find_package()`.
- Generate the plugin code project using **commsdsl2tools_qt**. Make sure the build of the code generator is enabled
  using appropriate [cmake options](../CMakeLists.txt).
- Build the project generated by the **commsdsl2tools_qt**. Use **CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH** to specify paths to the
  installation directories of the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms), the
  [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt), and the protocol definition project.
  Use **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX** to install the project artifacts to the same directory
  where [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt) have been installed.

After the last step is complete, the plugin code is properly built and installed to the same place as the
[CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt), the latter can select the
protocol definition plugin.
